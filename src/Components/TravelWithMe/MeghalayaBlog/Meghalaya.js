Bliss!! right!! Think
about how I felt when I saw the whole scene with my eyes &lt;3. Let us get back
to present day, where we are working our ass off or we are just chilling in
home (may be you are reading this on a weekend!!). Or you are planning a trip
to Meghalaya and want to know what this idiot blogger has done :D . You’ll like me… eventually…. May
be,,, may be not :D <br />
I have seen people assuming a lot when one says he/she is going on a solo trip.
Let me come directly to the part on why I went on a “Solo trip”:</div>

<span >1. </span><b>Assumption:</b>
The person going on a solo trip doesn’t have friends. He cannot talk to people
and he is a big time loser.<br />
<b>Answer:</b> I have a lot of friends!! I can definitely talk to a lot of people,
which is one of the biggest reason I wanted to go on a solo trip :D!! <br />
May be the loser part is true *weeps in a corner of the room*……. Well, not me
nor the person who went on the trip alone, but the person who goes everywhere
with his friends like a sheep flock will not know how much power and freedom is
within him when he goes alone!!</div>
<br />
<div align="left" >
<b>Assumption:</b>
Solo travellers have an inner agenda to do something bad to the society wherever
they go.<br />
<b>Answer:</b> Whhhhhhhaaaaaatttttt!?!</div>
<div align="left" >
<br /></div>
<div align="left" >
<br /></div>
<div align="left" >
<span> <b>Assumption:</b> They lack self confidence </span><br />
</div>
<b>Answer:</b> To actually increase your confidence, go on a solo trip. Lets face it,
going alone for the first time is quite a scary experience and there is a
certain amount of anxiety involved (the first time, at least). You’d have to
have some level of confidence in yourself to go ahead take that first step in
and know in your heart that everything will be okay, that you'll be ok in the
trip. This is nothing but self confidence, BITCHES!! :D<br />
<br />
<div align="left" >
<b>Assumption:</b> They are not good companions when
they go out with groups.<br />
<b>Answer:</b> wait wait wait.. how do I reply to this question....... Those who don’t go on solo trip do not have balls *dropping the mic*!!</div>

<b>My Trip Experience:</b></div>
<div align="left" >
My flight was scheduled
at 2:30 .a.m. IST from Bengaluru(Karnataka, India) to Kolkata(West Bengal,
India). And of course the air hostesses were looking dashingly beautiful early
in the morning!! I started wondering how someone can be up this early and smile
at everyone!! Never mind!! I reached Kolkata by 6 .a.m. IST. The best part is I
had a 12 hour transit time for my next flight to Guwahati. So, I had decided to explore “The city of
Joy”.
</div>
<div align="left" >
<br />
<b>Day 1: Kolkata</b>: The city of Joy.
For me this is the city where Swami Vivekananda was born. I have been to a lot
of speeches about Swami Vivekananda, about his personality and about his philosophical
teachings. “<i>Arise,awake and donot stop until the goal is reached.</i>” I
heard this distant voice in my head, ‘cause it was 7 o clock in the morning and
I had slept in the airport. I got up, freshened myself up and booked an OLA.
I had purposely booked an OLA Share so that I can roam around with locals and
know about their culture. Trust me when I say, the first person I met in Kolkata is
“Shahrukh” !!My OLA driver, Mohammed
Shahrukh :D!! A cool guy, wasn’t exited to actually go on any more trips as he
had been on a night shift. But once he asked me if I was alone (hearing my
broken hindi), he cheered up (I’m not that boring person to talk to anyway :P
). He told about how he came from elsewhere (his home place is confidential as
he did not want me to disclose about it) to Kolkata in search of job, about how
his family had come out of their financial trouble and finally how much he
loved this city. It was nice to talk to
him because I just felt how much I need to love my life. It is not about the
long term goals of life but it’s about the moment, the happy face he
had, the sense of accomplishment in his sleepless face which made my day better. Then a new guy enters the cab( OLA Share), in his yellow T
shirt, shorts and jogging shoes. He was a kind of a reserved person and stared
at me for the whole trip like I had come to his home town to snatch away the
joy from it. I didn’t want to feel weird and gave a meek smile and said “Hi” to
him. He again was staring, without any word. I turned away. Meanwhile Shahrukh
was the only person who was enjoying the whole trip. My destination was “The
Howrah Bridge”!! It took us around 45 min to reach from the airport. My other
passenger got down at a park on the way. While getting down he gave a meek
smile and said “Bye” imitating me. That was creepy, as I was alone and I
couldn’t sleep the last night and I was still thinking about my itinerary, and people started imitating me out of nowhere… huh…. Finally
reached the “Howrah Bridge”. <br />
<b>Howrah Bridge</b> - A brief history: <b>Howrah Bridge</b> is a bridge with a
suspended span over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in
1943,the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced
a pontoon bridge at the same location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata
(Calcutta). On 14 June 1965 it was renamed <b>Rabindra Setu</b> after the great
Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian Nobel
laureate. It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.<br />
The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous symbol of Kolkata
and West Bengal. The other bridges are the Vidyasagar Setu (popularly called
the Second Hooghly Bridge), the Vivekananda Setu, and the newly built Nivedita
Setu. It weathers the storms of the Bay of Bengal region, carrying a daily traffic
of approximately 100,000 vehicles and possibly more than 150,000 pedestrians,
easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the world. The third-longest
cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, the Howrah Bridge is
currently the sixth-longest bridge of its type in the world.<br />

</div>
And then I had 2 more places to visit in my mind: <b >Eden Gardens</b> and <b >Indian
Museum</b> within the next 2 hours which was practically not possible because
the time for travelling itself would take about 1 hour. I choose to walk on the
banks of Hoogli River, looking at the people, stopping at Ghats and staring at
the never ending waters. It took me around 1hour 30 min to reach Eden Gardens.
Indian Museum is about 15 min walk from Eden Gardens. But when I reached there,
I got to know that the Indian Museum opens only after 11.a.m. With a bit of
disappointment, I left to see another bridge, “Vidyasagar Sethu”. This
Sethu(Bridge) is actually a newly constructed bridge. This bridge is the
longest cable bridge in India and the second bridge constructed against the
Hoogli River.<br />

<br />
It was about 3 o’clock and I had to leave Kolkata and the next destination
was Guwahati (technically next destination was Shillong). I had a flight to
Guwahati at 6 in the evening. I still had a list of places to visit:
Ramakrishna Ashram, Science City, etc, etc, etc.. but anyways I had to leave.
So, I took the public transport from Howrah to the Airport. <br />
I reached Guwahati late at 8 as the flight got delayed. I immediately got a
cab to Shillong from Guwahati Airport. Reached the Hotel in Shillong by
11:30.p.m. Time to rest!!<br />
<br />
<b >Day2:</b> Didn’t stay in Shillong for a long time as I had to start my trek
to Nongriat the same day. So to reach the base of the trek, Tyrna Village,
which was 1 hour 30 mins far from Shillong, I had to leave early. We get a lot
of cabs from Shillong to Chirapunji. So,
I started from Shillong by 7 and reached Chirapunji by 8 .a.m. (in a shared
cab). Reached Chirapunji by 8. The roads look like a snake sweeping at the edge
of the ocean waves. On one side you see
rocks and steep greenery and on the other side you can see cliff which leads to
“clouds” and only “Clouds”. When I say “Clouds” trust me, I could only see
clouds. But when those clouds cleared, the scene which it gave the world to
adore is exemplarily beautiful:<br />

Then I got a cab from Chirapunjee to Tyrna Village. As I reached Tyrna, I
figured out how beautiful my trek would be. And suddenly I realized that I have
a 7kg rucksack on my shoulder, I freaked out a bit!! And all I had was my
enthusiasm to trek till Nongriat. I had one more sweet fact by a local who said
“It’s just 3500 steps!!” *sarcastically smiling*. Well, I was there and I had
to start the trek.<br />

Another view to say how B-E-A-utiful the nature is!</u></b><br />
<br /></div>
<div> 
At the middle of the trek, there was one girl kid, a local folk (5-7 years
old approx) who was staring at me. I didn’t know what to do as I was alone, I
was a bit scared then. It is in the middle of the jungle and a girl is staring
at me, think about it!! Then she showed me her hidden basket of wild pineapples,
cut and made into pieces. Then I understood that she was trying to sell the
pineapples. I politely refused and at that same time another girl (may be her
elder sister) standing at some distance told something in Khasi language and……
and…… that small girl started crying. Then I understood what was happening!! That
was a selling strategy!! I’ve always been a follower of Steve Jobs and there is
one strategy he tells all salesmen: “Don’t try to sell the product, but try to
sell the psychology of the product”. No one wants a kid to cry. Thus when the
kid starts to cry at least to console her I actually had to buy the pineapple. <br />
The whole trek was peaceful; I took periodic stops and finally somehow
reached the jungle lodge by 4 .p.m. I met Charlie there.
The special fact about Charlie is he can speak a lot of languages viz, English,
French, German, Khasi (Local Language) but not Hindi!! I had a little chat with
him and as I was tired I slept by 5:30.p.m. But wait a minute!! When I got up
it was 9 at night and a group of more trekkers came!! Finally some company to
be with!! I had a small chit chat with them, and thought of getting up early
the next day as the next destination was Rainbow falls, which was 2 hour trek
from the jungle lodge!!<br />

<b >Day3: Rainbow Falls!! </b><br />
<div>
I got up at 7:30 to find that everyone had left!! (Ok, solo trip for sure!!)
 I needed to trek alone in the jungle
*How exciting*!! And add to that, I felt my legs to be totally strained
from the previous day’s trek. I didn’t want to give up. So,
somehow got up, put on my rucksack, started the trek. I always thought, world
helps us to get what we desire. It is a very abstract idea I follow, but it
turned to be true that day. In my case, it was nature. Every time I was tired
and ran out of water, I could find a water stream besides me. Whenever my legs
couldn’t push forward, nature showed me how beautiful she is and she asked me
to push myself forward. Finally reached Rainbow Waterfalls by 8:40 a.m and
met some humans :D . To my surprise, I didn’t find any rainbows. I asked
Shabib(the one who left me alone in the jungle lodge, thinking that I didn’t
want to be disturbed), “why on earth did they name the falls after the Rainbow?” , He
started laughing at me. Even he was confused until we peeped over the falls to
see a depth of about 50 ft and “Rainbows” floating just above water. I felt
that rainbows were actually "in love" with water. They wouldn’t rise nor sink. Not
just one rainbow, but a set of many rainbows were present below the falls. <br />
Tip if you are going to rainbow falls: Don’t carry much luggage. Nature helps
only pure souls ( :P ). <br />

The jungle lodge is beside the Living root bridge. As I had reached the jungle
lodge late at night, I hadn’t seen the root bridge clearly. There are 2 bridges: Single Root
Bridge and Double Root Bridge. The "Chirapunjeethat" tribe has an inherited skill; they can twain living roots into bridges. Single Root Bridge
is on the same river which flows from the Rainbow falls, but the double root
bridge connects the two lands which are divided by another waterfalls (name unknown).<br />

As I reached Tyrna village, Lastborn was waiting.
While coming to tyrna, I had somehow pictured the whole route from Chirapunjee,
but now Lastborn was taking me in a different route. It was a bit confusing, but
I just let him do his job. But after half an hour, he stopped at a point and
told me to look at where we were. I felt like we had parked at the end
of the cliff. The cliff was actually the border of India and Bangladesh.<br />

Chirapunjee by 5:30 evening, to find out that there are no backpacker lodges available.
I had actually planned to stay in Nongriat for 3 days. But as the caves in Nongriat were flooded, "Charlie" told me not to go to the cave the next day. So I
decided to leave Nongriat and search for a place to stay in Chirapunjee (Sohra).
But Lastborn was there to help. He had his contacts in the town and got me a
backpacker place in the town. <br />

<iframe allowfullscreen="" l>Day 6: Dainthelean Falls and
Naikalikai Falls:<br /></iframe>
<div>
Early in the morning, I left for Dainthelean falls which happens to be 15
kms from Chirapunjee. Lastborn had sent his brother Ban (who also happens to be
a cab driver) to pick me. The route to the falls is “horribly good”. The
greenery, the air , it is a different experience to just stare at the nature.
We had to trek about 15 to 20 mins to reach the falls. The whole trek seemed
dangerous because the visibility was 10m max (cause of the fog). Felt like a “cold
heaven” for some time. As we reached the falls, it happens to look like the “Knights
Watch” from Game of thrones. There is a
special story behind the naming this falls, the story goes like this:<br />
“Once upon a time there lived a Snake(Dainth) in the middle of the jungle.
Whenever anyone had to pass the jungle, they had to be in even numbers .i.e. if
3 people tried to pass the jungle, then only 2 would come out on the other
side. The 3<sup>rd</sup> person would be the meal for the dainth. So people
from Sohra hired a snake catcher (Athelan) to catch the snake and free the
people from the misery. So, Athelan did his job, but did not know what to do
with such a vicious snake with him. He cooked the snake and asked Sohrians to
eat the snake as the Dainth would be reborn from its own flesh if left so. One
old women in the village, had a terrible memory, and she left the cooked
Dainth’s flesh without eating it. The Dainth was reborn.”<br />
Then I understood why Ban asked me if I was alone. If he alone accompanied me,
there’d be 2 of us. That would make an even number of us.<br />

The next destination was Naikalikai falls. This falls has its own  I was amazed with. It’s the cliff of the falls. It’s the
landscape which surrounded the falls. I could even see Nongriat from the cliff.
Nongriat looked like a tiny speck of land in between the greenery of nature.<br />

Evening, I went on a walk in Chirapunjee. The place is peaceful, has
Ramakrishna Ashram, Don Bosco church, Arwa cave and not to forget the loads of
love from the people. This happened to be the last day in Chirapunjee.<br />

<b >Day 7: Shillong</b><br />
<div>
Shillong has the biggest golf course in India and 2<sup>nd</sup> largest in
Asia. The main sport there is Football. The place is crowded and full of
fashion. One thing I noticed is that people don’t look their age,i.e., they
look very young for their age. I met a lot of people, made some friends and if
you are going to shilling, don’t forget to visit Shillong Café. Both, ambience
and food are out of the world :D  It’s
good.<br />

<b >Day 8: Guwahati:</b><br />
<div>
Early morning, got a cab to Guwahati. Reached Guwahati by 8 .a.m. Was lucky
to get a free city tour from the cab guy (maybe because I made a good friend
with "Arpan" :D). Arpan dropped me near the bed of Bramhaputra River. I took a Ferry ride on "India’s most vigorous
river" to an Island called Umanada. Best of all, met a soldier (Fauji
Chittaranjan bhai) who happened to be a radical and a skeptic thinker from
Kolkata. We had a chat about how well they preserve nature in these areas of
India, how people have destroyed the nature in the name of urbanization and
modernization. He told me how irritated he is with today’s youth going to pubs
and clubs rather than building something which will help in building the nation.<br />

The Saraighat bridge in Guwahati is one of the longest bridge and is the first
rail-cum-road bridge constructed over the Brahmaputra river in Guwahati. This
place has a historical meaning as this is the place where the legendary fight
between the Mughals and the Ahoms(rulers of Assam) took place, latter being the
winner!!<br />
